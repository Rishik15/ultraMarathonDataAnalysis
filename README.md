# Ultra Marathon Performance Analysis

This project is an exploratory analysis of ultra marathon running events from the year 2021. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to athletes' performance across different events, distances, and seasons.

## Initial Dataset from Kaggle

## Project Structure

- `DataCleaning.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the data cleaning procedures that were performed to prepare the data for analysis.
- `ExploratoryAnalysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, showcasing different analytical techniques and visualizations.

## Key Insights

- Analysis of athletes' average speed and performance times across different seasons.
- Event-specific analysis, identifying how the season the event was conducted on affected the athlete's performance.
- Age group analysis, determining how performance metrics vary across different age categories.

## Data

The data used in this analysis includes the following key metrics:

- Event name and date
- Distance of the event
- Number of finishers
- Athlete IDs, genders, and ages
- Athlete performance times and average speeds

The data was cleaned and processed to address inconsistencies and prepare it for detailed analysis.

## Visualizations

The project includes a series of visualizations created to illustrate the findings, such as:

- Bar charts comparing the average speeds and performance times across age groups.
- Box plots visualizing the distribution of athlete performances or average speeds across different seasons.

## Conclusions

The analysis provides insights into how factors like age and seasonality affect athlete performance in ultra marathon events. The findings from this project can be useful for event organizers, trainers, and athletes looking to optimize training and performance.

## Usage

To explore the analysis, open the Jupyter notebooks in an environment that supports `.ipynb` files, such as JupyterLab or VS Code.
